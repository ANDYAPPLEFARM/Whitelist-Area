# FOR WHITELISTERS AND WHATNOT WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADD HWIDS:

1. Create a comma before creating a enterbreak, but this step can be skipped if there's already a comma. For example:

"###_###_###", -- After the ", create a comma to ensure that you don't screw up the table.

2. Create a enterbreak by pressing enter then creating two quotation marks and inbetween those two quotation marks, you insert the HWID. For example:

"###_###_###", -- Previous
"YOUR_HWID_INSERT", -- New. And create a comma.

# That's it! only 2 steps. Good luck!
